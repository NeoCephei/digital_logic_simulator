# Digital Logic Simulator
Project inspired by a youtube video from [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZwneRb-zqA)
You can find the original repo [here](https://github.com/SebLague/Digital-Logic-Sim) which is coded using C#

Thanks to Simon Tiger who also have a video explanation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27RrNoPy8Hg) with a js implementation of the program

## Description
The program allows you to create your own custom logic circuits, and store them as Chips for future usage.
You will start with **Not** and **And** gates, from there you can create a **Nand** gate that will allow you to create all the logic gates, and from there your imagination takes control.

## How does it works?
You will start with an empty canvas.
Click on the left or right edge to create inputs or outputs.
Drag and drop your chips to create a gate.
Click and drag from black circles to create connections, you can press 'W' to create waypoints.
Store your circuit in a small and practical chip.

## Future Plans
* Complete Backend functionallity to store your creations.
* Creation of new types of inputs like 'clocks'.
* Deployment for online usage.
* Spread Logic in different components.
